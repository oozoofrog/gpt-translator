00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,852
Hi, I’m Lori Smallwood,
an Engineering Manager

2
00:00:09,873 --> 00:00:13,284
for 3D content creation workflows
in the Vision Products Group.

3
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:17,950
In this talk, I’ll go over how we’ve made
the creation of 3D content easier

4
00:00:17,975 --> 00:00:21,091
than ever before
when using USD and MaterialX.

5
00:00:21,545 --> 00:00:24,811
I’ll outline how these technologies
provide a strong foundation

6
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:27,760
for 3D content creation and interchange.

7
00:00:28,587 --> 00:00:32,578
Then, I’ll tell you about some USD
and MaterialX updates in RealityKit

8
00:00:32,955 --> 00:00:36,109
followed by advancements
in creative tooling on macOS.

9
00:00:37,099 --> 00:00:41,021
With USD and MaterialX, Apple has embraced
the use of industry standard,

10
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:44,019
open source software
to form a strong foundation for creators

11
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,052
like you to develop content.

12
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:49,072
These technologies work together
to streamline content development

13
00:00:49,093 --> 00:00:52,220
across a range of applications
and industries.

14
00:00:52,617 --> 00:00:55,203
OpenUSD, originally developed at Pixar,

15
00:00:55,224 --> 00:00:58,700
enables the standardized
interchange of 3D assets and scenes.

16
00:00:59,728 --> 00:01:02,652
MaterialX, which was developed
at Industrial Light and Magic,

17
00:01:02,673 --> 00:01:04,513
is used to portably represent shaders

18
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:07,244
which provide
the visual look of the 3D content.

19
00:01:07,913 --> 00:01:09,868
USD and MaterialX empower you

20
00:01:09,889 --> 00:01:13,210
to capture your creativity and bring it
to life in front of your eyes.

21
00:01:13,475 --> 00:01:15,493
From immersive feature
films, to indie games

22
00:01:15,514 --> 00:01:17,712
and beautiful spatial experiences,

23
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:21,718
you can use the same workflows between
all your projects, and in the applications

24
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:23,251
in which you’re most comfortable.

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,889
Vision Pro really highlights
the scalability

26
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,522
enabled by consistent workflows

27
00:01:27,543 --> 00:01:30,913
through apps like
Apple TV+, Max and Disney+,

28
00:01:30,934 --> 00:01:34,447
which let you be immersed in environments
created with the same technologies

29
00:01:34,468 --> 00:01:36,526
powering the films you watch within them.

30
00:01:37,116 --> 00:01:40,416
The images you see on your displays
are produced by rendering engines.

31
00:01:40,753 --> 00:01:43,270
To streamline the creation
of spatial experiences,

32
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:45,974
we’ve made several advancements
in two of the rendering engines

33
00:01:45,995 --> 00:01:48,862
available on our platforms:
RealityKit and Storm.

34
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:53,126
Both support USD and MaterialX,
and cater to different production needs.

35
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,962
RealityKit is a powerful realtime engine

36
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:58,900
that can help you create
amazing spatial experiences.

37
00:02:00,212 --> 00:02:02,681
It powers visionOS, and applications like

38
00:02:02,702 --> 00:02:06,001
QuickLook on your phone
and Reality Composer Pro on your Mac.

39
00:02:06,423 --> 00:02:08,690
You can use RealityKit
in your own applications

40
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:11,698
to leverage the unique
capabilities of our platforms.

41
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:17,388
Storm is Pixar’s real-time renderer
included with OpenUSD.

42
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,560
It is commonly used in content creation
applications like DaVinci Resolve,

43
00:02:21,693 --> 00:02:24,224
and on macOS we make it
available in Preview

44
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:26,636
to provide a familiar
and convenient experience

45
00:02:26,657 --> 00:02:28,956
for professionals
targeting those workflows.

46
00:02:30,344 --> 00:02:34,709
RealityKit has some great USD
and MaterialX changes in store this year.

47
00:02:35,096 --> 00:02:38,990
Last year we announced Vision Pro
and visionOS, where we introduced

48
00:02:39,011 --> 00:02:42,706
a number of new RealityKit
features to enable gorgeous content.

49
00:02:43,026 --> 00:02:46,404
This includes support
for MaterialX shaders in ShaderGraph,

50
00:02:46,425 --> 00:02:49,495
a shader creation system
within Reality Composer Pro.

51
00:02:50,706 --> 00:02:53,482
Now we’re bringing those same features
to our other platforms,
